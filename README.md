Hands-On Workshop: Responsive Design with Visualforce and Bootstrap
===================================================================

##About the Workbook##

This workbook shows you how to create a Visualforce page that utilises the Bootstrap responsive web design framework to adapt to the device it is being viewed on. No prior coding experience is necessary, however, a basic understanding of HTML and Visualforce is helpful.

Visualforce is a component-based user interface framework for the Salesforce1 platform. Using Visualforce, developers create custom user-interfaces to Salesforce applications and data.  While Visualforce is well-suited to build custom pages targetted at desktop users, it is less-suited to users who required a consistent user interface across a number of devices.
